Bugs
  Double check the fan out and fan in
     does it had double layers

Model Call
	- Specify model from registry
	- Specify instructions
	- Specify prompt with argument resolution using path resolution for get
	- Specify the output path for the result
	- Output as text or json for structured output
	  Copy the OpenAI / Gemini method of defining the structued output (defined and advanced schema)
	- Show the input and output context

Model Registry
	- Define OpenAI direct and Azure OpenAI as connectors
	- Define model name
	- Define end point
	- Define authentication, start with just api key, secret name, (for secrets.json) and then other which means you handle it in overrides
	- Allow user to optionally specify the parameters allowed for OpenAIExecutionSettings
	- Add test button to check connectivity

# Integration Overrides

Models
	- Connector building
	  Just override the authentication entry
	  Just override the openaiexecutionsettings
	  Override it all by you returning the actual connector instance
	  
Build
    - Different interfaces for specifying the list of custom serializers
	  1 to find them in the assemblies automatically
	  Another that asks you to list them by type

# Process
